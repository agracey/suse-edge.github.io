## What is Elemental?

Elemental is a software stack that provides for remote control over the lifecycles of the Operating System, Kubernetes, and workload in a secure and declarative way. 



## Why use this method

Elemental can be very useful for scenarios where the devices that you want to control are not on the same network as the upstream cluster or don't have a BMC onboard to allow more direct control. 

TODO: expand

## High Level Architecture

TODO: Draw image 

## Resources Needed

At the very least, you need:
- A host for the "upstream" cluster (the one hosting Rancher and Elemental) with: 
  - Minimum 8GB RAM and 20GB disk space for development or testing
  - For production use: See https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements#hardware-requirements
- A host to be controlled
  - Could be physical device or Virtual Machine
  - Minimum 25GB disk
- A resolvable hostname
  - Or static ip address to use with a service like sslip.io 
- A host to build the installation media with
  - This would likely be your local computer for most people
  - [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/), [Podman](https://podman.io), and [Helm](https://helm.sh) need to be installed
  - TODO: edit this after writing the EIB doc
- (If using physical hardware) A USB flash drive to boot from
  - Existing will be overwritten as part of the process

In the writing of this guide, I will be using a Digital Ocean droplet to host the upstream cluster and an Intel NUC as the downstream device. For building the installation media, I will be using my desktop running [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/).

## How to Use Elemental

The basic steps to install and use Elemental are:

- Build bootstrap cluster 
- Install Rancher
- Install Elemental Operator and Rancher UI Extension
- Build installer disk 
- Boot device with installer
- Create downstream cluster

TODO: Record video and embed 

### Build Bootstrap Cluster

The first thing we need to do is create a cluster that can host Rancher and Elemental. This cluster needs to be routable from the network that the downstream nodes are connected to. 

TODO: make prose
- Create Kubernetes Cluster 
- Install Rancher
- Install Elemental
- (Optionally) Install Elemental UI Extension

#### Create Kubernetes Cluster

If you are using a hyperscaler (such as Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud), it's likely easiest to set up a cluster using their built in tooling. For the sake of conciseness in this guide, we will not be detailing the process of each of these options.

If you are installing onto bare metal or another hosting service where you need to also provide the Kubernetes distribution itself, we recommend using [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/install/quickstart). 

TODO: Should I add more detail?

#### Setup DNS

Before continuing, you will need to setup access to your cluster. As with the setup of the cluster itself, how you configure DNS will be different depending on where it's being hosted.

:::tip 
If you don't want to deal with setting up DNS records (for example this is just an ephemeral test server), you can use a service like [sslip.io](https://sslip.io) instead. With this service, you can resolve any ip address with `<address>.sslip.io`. 
:::

#### Install Rancher

To install Rancher, you need to get access to the kubeapi of the cluster you just created. This looks differently depending on what distribution of Kubernetes is being used. 

For RKE2,the kubeconfig file will have been written to `/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml`. Save this file to `~/.kube/config` on your local system. You may need to edit the file to include the correct externally routable IP address or hostname. 


The simplest way to get Rancher installed is with these commands that can be found in the [Rancher Documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster):

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
  Install [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io):

```powershell
helm repo add rancher-latest https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest
kubectl create namespace cattle-system

```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::note
If this is intended to be a production system, please use cert-manager to configure a real certificate (such as one from Let's Encrypt). 
:::

Browse to the hostname you set up and log in to Rancher with the bootstrapPassword you used. There is a short setup process that you will be guided through.


#### Install Elemental

With Rancher installed, you can now install Elemental itself!

The helm chart for Elemental is published as an OCI artifact so the installation is a little simpler than other charts. It can be installed from either the same shell you used to install Rancher or in the browser from within Rancher's shell.

```bash
helm install --create-namespace -n cattle-elemental-system elemental-operator-crds oci://registry.suse.com/rancher/elemental-operator-crds-chart
helm install --create-namespace -n cattle-elemental-system elemental-operator oci://registry.suse.com/rancher/elemental-operator-chart
```

#### Optionally Install the Elemental UI Extension

If you want to use the Elemental UI...

TODO: write

#### Configure Elemental

To allow machines to register to Elemental, we need to create a MachineRegistration object in the `fleet-default` namespace.

A fairly basic version of this object is:

TODO: Does the EIB/Elemental integration respect the spec in this file?

```yaml
apiVersion: elemental.cattle.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineRegistration
metadata:
  name: ele-quickstart-nodes
  namespace: fleet-default
spec:
  machineName: "${System Information/Manufacturer}-${System Information/Serial Number}"
  machineInventoryLabels:
    manufacturer: "${System Information/Manufacturer}"
    productName: "${System Information/Product Name}"
    registration: "ele-quickstart-nodes"
```


We can create this object in a few ways:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">
    Create a file with the yaml from above called `registration.yaml` the apply it with:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f registration.yaml
    ```


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="visual" label="UI Extension">
    TODO: Create screenshot
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Afterwards, find and note the endpoint that gets assigned: 

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get machineregistration ele-quickstart-nodes -n fleet-default -o jsonpath '{.status.registrationURL}'
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="visual" label="UI Extension">
    TODO: Create screenshot
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Build installation media

While the current version of Elemental (at time of writing) does have a way to build it's own installation media, we need to do this with the Edge Image Builder instead so the resulting system is built with [SLE Micro](https://www.suse.com/products/micro/) as the base Operating System. 

:::tip
For more details on the Edge Image Builder, you can check out the [Getting Started Guide for it](/docs/quickstart/eib). Or, for a more full discussion on it's capabilities there is a [full page documenting it].

TODO: write the simplest EIB flow possible here

If you are booting a physical device, we need to burn the image to a USB flash drive. This can be done with:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>
    TODO: how to find sdX

    ```bash
    sudo dd if=/path/to/output.iso of=/dev/sdX
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="OSX" label="Mac OS">
    TODO: any difference? 
    
    ```bash
    sudo dd if=/path/to/output.iso of=/dev/sdX
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    TODO: ???
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Boot downstream nodes

Now that we have the installation media created, we can boot our downstream nodes with it.

For each of the systems that you want to control with Elemental, add the installation media and boot the device. After installation, it will reboot and register itself.

If you are using the UI Extension, you should see your node appear in the "Inventory of Machines".


### Create downstream clusters

Now that Elemental can see and control our downstream machines, we can create a cluster from those machine.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

  There are two objects that we need to create when provisioning a new cluster using Elemental. 

  The first is the MachineInventorySelectorTemplate. This object allows us to specify a mapping between Clusters and the machines in inventory. 

  Create a file called `selector.yaml` with the contents:

  ```yaml
apiVersion: elemental.cattle.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineInventorySelectorTemplate
metadata:
  name: location-123-selector
  namespace: fleet-default
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabel:
          locationID: 123
  ```

  The we can create it with 

  ```bash
kubectl create -f selector.yaml 
  ```

  This will match any machine in the inventory with the label `locationID: 123` so we need to add this label to the machines that should be matched. We can do this with:

  ```bash
  kubectl label MachineInventory -n fleet-default <name of MachineInventory object> locationID=123
  ``` 

  Next, we create the cluster itself. There are a lot of options here but a simple single-node K3s Cluster looks like: 

  ```yaml
apiVersion: provisioning.cattle.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: location-123
  namespace: fleet-default
spec:
  kubernetesVersion: v1.26.11+k3s2
  rkeConfig:
    machinePools:
      - name: pool1
        etcdRole: true
        controlPlaneRole: true
        workerRole: true
        machineConfigRef:
          kind: MachineInventorySelectorTemplate
          name: location-123-selector
          apiVersion: elemental.cattle.io/v1beta1
          quantity: 1
  ```

  To provision this cluster, we can create a file with these contents called `cluster.yaml` and run 

```bash
kubectl create -f cluster.yaml
```
    
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="visual" label="UI Extension">

  The UI extension allows for a few shortcuts to be taken. 

  TODO: Screenshots

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After creating these objects, you should see a new kubernetes cluster spin up using the new node you just installed with. 

## Next steps
TODO: prose

Some recommended next steps after using this guide are:

- End to end automation with Fleet (TODO: Create page and link)
- Additional network configuration options (TODO: Link to right section in EIB)
- TODO: ???

## Planned changes

There are a few changes to this that are currently planned (at time of writing):

#### Direct support for and integration with SLE Micro 6.x

TODO: write more about this

- Image building
- Both A/B and RPM based transactional updates
- UI improvements for non-teal images

This is expected to be included in the SUSE Edge 3.1 

## Additional Resources

TODO: What additional resources should we link?
