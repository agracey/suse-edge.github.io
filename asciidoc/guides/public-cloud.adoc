== Networking and Topology

image::elemental-architecture-cloud.png[]

Downstream clusters need to have access to the Rancher server that's managing it. This means that we need to provide a FQDN that's resolves to a LoadBalancer that routes the traffic to Rancher. 

In the public cloud, this typically is done through the tools provided by your cloud provider. 

The documentation for installing Rancher into each of the major cloud providers can be found here:

- https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster/rancher-on-amazon-eks[Amazon AWS]
- https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster/rancher-on-aks[Microsoft Azure]
- https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster/rancher-on-gke[Google Cloud]

=== SUSE Manager

It can also be advantageous to use https://documentation.suse.com/suma/5.0/[SUSE Manager] to reduce network traffic for updates along with reducing risk of losing access to individual nodes with a "belt and suspenders" approach. 

At the most basic level, SUSE Manager allows for remotely managing hosts and their update lifecycle while acting as a centralized and secure funnel for packages. As part of this, you can lock down package versions while allowing promoting new versions across dev/test/prod environments.

=== Cloud Marketplace

SUSE also maintains offerings in the marketplace of the most commonly used cloud providers.

More information about these offerings can be found https://www.suse.com/solutions/public-cloud/[here]. 

== Sizing Considerations

The number of downstream clusters a single Rancher server is able to manage is influenced by both the number of objects being created for each cluster as well as the size of the VMs hosting the management cluster's workers.

=== Object Count

Rancher creates several Kubernetes objects for each cluster which affects it's performance. The amount of objects that are created depends on factors such as:

- # of Roles/RoleBindings
- # of Users
- # of workloads 
- # of extensions being used
